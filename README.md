Analysis of the first multi-messenger event, GW170817/GRB170817/AT2017gfo  using the Multi Order Coverage map (MOC):

The tutorial aims to analyze the [first multi-messenger event, GW170817/GRB170817/AT2017gfo](https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW170817MMA/index.php) using the Multi Order Coverage map (MOC) to encode the gravitational-wave sky localizations from the LIGO and Virgo collaborations, and the gamma-ray-burst error boxes provided by the GBM instrument on board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and calculate from the IPN triangulation using the delay between Fermi and INTEGRAL.
